            <p>
             OTU is an operational taxonomic unit.<br> 
             <br>
             Operational taxonomic unit or OTU is considered as the basic unit used in numerical taxonomy. 
             These units may refer to an individual, species, genus, or class. 
             In numerical methods, the taxonomic units used are constantly not comparable to the formal taxonomic units.

            <p>
             Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and gently rub the surfaces inside your navel.
             Next, use a fresh one dipped in water to rinse the alcohol so it doesn’t dry your skin.

          <h4>We Are Never Alone: Living with the Human Microbiota</h4>
          <p>
            The human body is inhabited by millions of tiny living organisms, which, all together, are called the human microbiota. Bacteria are microbes found on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and especially in the gut. 
            We acquire these bacteria during birth and the first years of life, and they live with us throughout our lives. 
            The human microbiota is involved in healthy growth, in protecting the body from invaders, in helping digestion, and in regulating moods. 
            Some changes in the microbiota may occur during our growth, depending on the foods we eat, the environment in which we live, the people and animals that interact with us, or medicines that we take, such as antibiotics. 
            The human microbiota helps us to keep us healthy, but sometimes these bacteria can also be harmful. We need to take good care of our microbiota to avoid the development of some diseases, such as obesity and asthma. 
            We should eat healthy foods that contribute to the development of a healthy microbiota.
